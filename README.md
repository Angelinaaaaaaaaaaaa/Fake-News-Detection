# Fake-News-Detection

### Introduction
In this project, we explore fake news detection using text-based classification methods, aiming to understand how machine learning models can effectively identify fraudulent news articles. Our primary objectives were to compare the performance of baseline and advanced models, investigate whether the LSTM model captures features similar to those highlighted by TFIDF, and study the effect of sample size on model performance.
